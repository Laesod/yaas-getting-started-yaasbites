## YaaS Bites

Welcome to [Yaas Bites](https://yaasbiteindex.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/)' github repository: small, focused coding exercises that:
- get a developer from 0 to [Yaas](https://www.yaas.io/) in a couple of days
- ensure a Developers' initial journeys into YaaS are successful, so that they come back encouraged and hungry for more.
- assume only that you know Java and basic Spring
- are ready for you to learn right now @ [Yaas Bites](https://yaasbiteindex.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/)

## What is YaaS?
[Yaas](https://www.yaas.io/) is a powerful framework that promises to change the face of e-commerce software development. YaaS Development is not trivial, and learning it can be confusing and frustrating; you need familiarity with many technologies and terminologies before things start to make sense (REST, Jersey, Cloud CLI, Manifest, RAML, Angular, Restangular, YaaS Builder, YaaS DevPortal, Scopes, Required-Scopes, Tenants, Packages, Subscriptions, Builder Modules, Proxies and more).

[Yaas Bites](https://yaasbiteindex.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/) explores ways to make learning YaaS easy and even fun, so that new developers immediately experience success in the YaaS landscape.
