# yaas-getting-started-yaasbites

YaaS is a powerful framework that promises to change the face of e-commerce software development, and Yaas Bites gets developers from 0 to YaaS quickly and efficiently. If you are brand new to YaaS you should read the Why YaaS page which explains the key business needs YaaS fulfills, and the enormous potential it unleashes to e-commerce developers.

YaaS Development is not trivial, and learning it can be confusing and frustrating; you need familiarity with many technologies and terminologies before things start to make sense (REST, Jersey, Cloud CLI, Manifest, RAML, Angular, Restangular, YaaS Builder, YaaS DevPortal, Scopes, Required-Scopes, Tenants, Packages, Subscriptions, Builder Modules, Proxies and more). 

YaaSBites explores ways to make learning YaaS easier and even fun, and consists of small, incremental coding exercises, that are easy yet critical to understand. Its goal is to ensure that a Software Developer's initial journies into YaaS are productive and that they come back encouraged, and hungry for more. It assumes only that a developer knows Java and some Spring, and takes you quickly into working productively with YaaS. It is also a necessary introduction for working with the YaaS Service SDK and for getting maximum benefit from the comprehensive Wishlist tutorial, both discussed in Bite 10 "Using the YaaS Service SDK".

The YaaSBites are also a part of tutorial series which will be published on [SAP Tutorial Catalog](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials.html). The tutorial series serves as an introduction to YaaS. The tutorial go through the process of creating a YaaS project, exploring the default YaaS Storefront, extending the default Yaas Storefront with a micro service, creating your own storefront with your own YaaS project and also deploying a YaaS based microservice to SAP Hana Cloud Platform. Ther list of tutorials series in a sequence is available below with a short description for each tutorial.


## Tutorials
1. Getting Started with YaaS: You will get started with YaaS and create your own YaaS project. This project will be used for the creation of a storefront. You will learn about the Builder which is the back-office client of YaaS. You will also get familiar with the YaaS Market where you can subscribe to different packages of your choice.
2. Download and Run the Default YaaS Storefront: A YaaS Storefront is a customizable, feature-rich-online Storefront web interface, supported by a backing YaaS Project, whose purpose is to give end-users a smooth online store experience. It is based on Node.js, Angular and Restangular. In this tutorial, you will download and run a default YaaS Storefront.    
3. Extend the YaaS Storefront's Functionality with a Micro Service: In this tutorial you will extend the Storefront using a micro service. The aim is to include a button in the Storefront's Product Details page that gives helpful Tips to the undecided purchaser, such as "This would add to your overall coolness", and "One word: No". To achieve this, you will run the Tips micro service locally and connect it to YaaS Storefront. The tips are communicated via REST calls to YaaS Storefront.
4. Use Your Own YaaS Project to Back your Storefront: By default, the StoreFront is wired to the YaaS Project default project (created by the StoreFront's own Team). This default project has already been wired up and populated with the Products (and Services) that you can browse. You will now use our own YaaS Project which you created earlier instead of the default one.
5. Deploy a Micro Service Built on YaaS on the SAP HCP: In this tutorial you will set up a cloud account on the HANA Cloud Platform through your YaaS project. You will then use the Tips micro service from previous tutorials. First you will deploy it and then run it on the cloud.
