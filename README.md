# yaas-getting-started-yaasbites
The YaaSBites support software developers on their initial journies to learn about YaaS. The bites are each short projects with the purpose of introducing YaaS technology and terminology. The YaaSBites are part of a tutorial series.

## Overview
YaaS is a powerful framework that promises to change the face of e-commerce software development. YaaS Development is not trivial, and learning it can be confusing and frustrating; you need familiarity with many technologies and terminologies before things start to make sense.

YaaSBites explores ways to make learning YaaS easier, and consists of small, incremental coding exercises, that are easy yet critical to understand. Its goal is to ensure that a Software Developer's initial journies into YaaS are productive and that they come back encouraged. It assumes only that a developer knows Java and some Spring, and takes you quickly into working productively with YaaS. It is also a necessary introduction for working with the YaaS Service SDK and for getting maximum benefit from the comprehensive Wishlist tutorial, both discussed in Bite 10 "Using the YaaS Service SDK".
