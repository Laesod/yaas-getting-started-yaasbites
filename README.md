# yaas-getting-started-yaasbites

YaaS is a powerful framework that promises to change the face of e-commerce software development, and Yaas Bites gets developers from 0 to YaaS quickly and efficiently. If you are brand new to YaaS you should read the Why YaaS page which explains the key business needs YaaS fulfills, and the enormous potential it unleashes to e-commerce developers.

YaaS Development is not trivial, and learning it can be confusing and frustrating; you need familiarity with many technologies and terminologies before things start to make sense (REST, Jersey, Cloud CLI, Manifest, RAML, Angular, Restangular, YaaS Builder, YaaS DevPortal, Scopes, Required-Scopes, Tenants, Packages, Subscriptions, Builder Modules, Proxies and more). 

YaaSBites explores ways to make learning YaaS easier and even fun, and consists of small, incremental coding exercises, that are easy yet critical to understand. Its goal is to ensure that a Software Developer's initial journies into YaaS are productive and that they come back encouraged, and hungry for more. It assumes only that a developer knows Java and some Spring, and takes you quickly into working productively with YaaS. It is also a necessary introduction for working with the YaaS Service SDK and for getting maximum benefit from the comprehensive Wishlist tutorial, both discussed in Bite 10 "Using the YaaS Service SDK".

The YaaSBites are also a part of tutorial series which will be published on [SAP Tutorial Catalog](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials.html). The tutorial series serves as an introduction to YaaS. The tutorial go through the process of creating a YaaS project, exploring the default YaaS Storefront, extending the default Yaas Storefront with a micro service, creating your own storefront with your own YaaS project and also deploying a YaaS based microservice to SAP Hana Cloud Platform. Ther list of tutorials series in a sequence is available below.
